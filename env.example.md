### How to Use the `.env` File for Environment Configuration

To configure your application's environment settings, you'll need to create and utilize a file named `.env`. Here's a quick guide on how to do it:

1. **Rename the File**: Locate the configuration file provided (e.g., `example.txt`), and rename it to `.env`. Make sure the file extension changes to `.env`. On some systems, you may need to enable the option to view hidden files to see and rename the file.

2. **Set Environment Variables**: Open the `.env` file in a text editor. Inside, you'll define various configuration variables needed for your application. Each line typically follows the `KEY=value` format, where `KEY` is the name of the variable, and `value` is its corresponding value.

   For example:
   ``` plaintext
   MONGO_URL=you connection string here (nodejs driver)
   ```
