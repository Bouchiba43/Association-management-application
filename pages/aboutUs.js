        <p>Nowadays, digital technology has completely changed working methods in all areas.
            Information and communication technologies have evolved enormously in recent years. The

            application has become a necessity in terms of developing relationships with members. The
            advantages are numerous and the work of the board members is greatly facilitated. It helps to
            multiply the means to find funds, recruit and train new members who can participate in the smooth
            running of the associationâ€™s activities.</p>
